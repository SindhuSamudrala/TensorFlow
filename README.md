# TensorFlow
Scalar: Scalars are just numerical values
Vectors: Vectors are simply a list of scalar values
Matrices: Same as vectors matrices are generalized vectors from order one to order two.
Tensors: Tensors give us a generic representation of describing n-dimensional arrays with an arbitrary number of axes.
They are mostly used for representing the images that have height, width, and channel axes.
Norms: In linear algebra, a vector norm is a function  f  that maps a vector to a scalar, satisfying a handful of properties.
